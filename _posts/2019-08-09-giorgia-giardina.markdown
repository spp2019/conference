Dr. Giardina is an expert in structural damage, infrastructure assessment, remote sensing, soil-structure interaction, and earthquake engineering. After obtaining a PhD in Civil Engineering and Geosciences from TU Delft (the Netherlands), she was a Research Associate in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge and then joined the University of Bath as a lecturer. Her latest research focuses on new space radar techniques to detect deformation in structures, and has shown promising applications in risk and damage assessment of critical infrastructure. In a collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, this research was applied to analyse signs of distress of the Ponte Morandi in Genoa, Italy, which collapsed in August 2018.
