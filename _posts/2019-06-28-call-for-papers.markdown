#### Presenters – who should speak at SPP Italy 2019 in Cambridge?

Are you a young researcher (__PhD or Postdoc__ level) interested in how research can influence policy? 
Try your hands at science policy and present research to policymakers!

SPP Italy 2019 offers you the opportunity to develop and showcase your science communication skills by presenting research evidence to policymakers. <br/>

#### Themes and topics – what do we expect?

We invite attendees to submit a poster reviewing the state of the evidence relevant to a policy issue. The topic of your poster must fall under one of the 3 key themes of the conference: 

* __Energy and the environment__: climate change. energy policy, renewable energy technologies, transport etc. 
* __Public health and biotechnologies__: stem cells, regenerative medicine, gene editing etc. 
* __Digital technologies__: machine learning, artificial intelligence, pervasive computing, internet of things etc. 

<br/>

#### Guidelines on the content of presentations

You should:
* Choose a policy topic relevant to the conference themes, with a focus on Italy (be specific and choose something tractable -  climate change might be too large, Italy’s implementation of renewable targets to comply with the Paris Agreement is more tractable)
* Identify the key policy issues, trends, and drivers
* Review and summarise the relevant existing research and evidence 
* Identify policy options based on the available evidence
* Ensure you communicate clearly and succinctly to a policy audience

The topic of the poster does not have to be your specific topic of research - it can be anything from your area of research that you are passionate about and has policy implications. <br/>
